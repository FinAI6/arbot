# Arbitrage Strategy

ArBot's arbitrage strategy engine is the core component that identifies and evaluates price differences between exchanges. This sophisticated system combines real-time data analysis, statistical methods, and risk management to find profitable trading opportunities.

## How Arbitrage Works

### Basic Concept

**Traditional Arbitrage:**
Buy low on Exchange A, sell high on Exchange B, profit from the price difference.

**Example:**
```
Bitcoin Price:
Exchange A (Bybit): $43,250
Exchange B (Binance): $43,350

Opportunity: Buy on Bybit, sell on Binance
Gross Profit: $100 per Bitcoin
```

### ArBot's Enhanced Approach

**Real-Time Analysis:**
- Continuous price monitoring across all exchanges
- Sub-second opportunity detection
- Automatic fee and slippage calculations
- Risk-adjusted profit estimation

**Smart Filtering:**
- Trend-based opportunity selection
- Premium detection and outlier filtering
- Liquidity-based sizing
- Market condition adaptation

## Strategy Components

### Price Data Collection

**WebSocket Feeds:**
```python
# Real-time ticker structure
{
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "exchange": "binance",
    "bid": 43250.50,
    "ask": 43251.00,
    "bid_size": 2.5,
    "ask_size": 1.8,
    "timestamp": 1640995200.123
}
```

**Data Validation:**
- Price sanity checks (outlier detection)
- Timestamp validation (freshness)
- Size validation (minimum liquidity)
- Cross-reference verification

### Opportunity Detection

**Spread Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_arbitrage(buy_exchange, sell_exchange):
    # Get execution prices
    buy_price = buy_exchange.ask  # We buy at ask
    sell_price = sell_exchange.bid  # We sell at bid
    
    # Calculate fees
    buy_fee = buy_price * buy_exchange.taker_fee
    sell_fee = sell_price * sell_exchange.taker_fee
    
    # Account for slippage
    slippage_cost = buy_price * slippage_tolerance
    
    # Net profit calculation
    gross_profit = sell_price - buy_price
    total_costs = buy_fee + sell_fee + slippage_cost
    net_profit = gross_profit - total_costs
    
    return net_profit / buy_price  # Profit percentage
```

**Profitability Factors:**
1. **Price Spread**: Difference between exchanges
2. **Trading Fees**: Maker/taker fees on both sides
3. **Slippage**: Expected price movement during execution
4. **Market Impact**: Effect of trade size on price

### Signal Generation

**Arbitrage Signal Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class ArbitrageSignal:
    symbol: str
    buy_exchange: str
    sell_exchange: str
    buy_price: float
    sell_price: float
    profit: float
    profit_percent: float
    buy_size: float
    sell_size: float
    timestamp: float
    confidence: float
```

**Signal Quality Metrics:**
- **Profit Percentage**: Expected return
- **Confidence Score**: Based on data quality and timing
- **Liquidity Score**: Available size for execution
- **Risk Score**: Market condition assessment

## Advanced Features

### Trend-Based Filtering

**Strategy Enhancement:**
Traditional arbitrage doesn't consider market direction. ArBot's trend filtering only executes trades when market momentum is favorable.

**Filter Modes:**

#### Uptrend Buy Low
```python
# Only trade during upward price trends
if trend == "↗":
    # Buy from lower-priced exchange
    # Market momentum helps secure profits
    execute_arbitrage()
```

#### Downtrend Sell High
```python
# Only trade during downward price trends
if trend == "↘":
    # Sell to higher-priced exchange
    # Downward momentum maintains spreads
    execute_arbitrage()
```

#### Both Directions
```python
# Trade in any trending market
if trend in ["↗", "↘"]:
    # Avoid sideways/choppy markets
    execute_arbitrage()
```

### Premium Detection

**Statistical Analysis:**
ArBot analyzes historical price patterns to identify exchange-specific premiums and filter out anomalous spreads.

**Premium Calculation:**
```python
def detect_premium(symbol, exchange_pair, lookback_periods=100):
    # Get historical spreads
    historical_spreads = get_spread_history(symbol, exchange_pair, lookback_periods)
    
    # Calculate baseline premium
    baseline = median(historical_spreads)
    std_dev = standard_deviation(historical_spreads)
    
    # Current spread analysis
    current_spread = get_current_spread(symbol, exchange_pair)
    z_score = (current_spread - baseline) / std_dev
    
    # Filter outliers (likely errors)
    if abs(z_score) > outlier_threshold:
        return "outlier"  # Skip this opportunity
    
    return baseline
```

**Benefits:**
- Filters out data errors and manipulation
- Identifies legitimate regional premiums
- Improves signal quality
- Reduces false positives

### Dynamic Symbol Selection

**Volume-Based Prioritization:**
```python
def select_dynamic_symbols(max_symbols=200):
    # Get all available symbols
    all_symbols = get_exchange_symbols()
    
    # Filter by quote currency
    filtered_symbols = filter_by_quote_currency(all_symbols)
    
    # Sort by 24h volume
    volume_sorted = sort_by_volume(filtered_symbols)
    
    # Select top N symbols
    return volume_sorted[:max_symbols]
```

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Trading Volume**: Higher volume = better liquidity
2. **Quote Currency**: Focus on USDT, USDC, etc.
3. **Spread History**: Symbols with consistent arbitrage opportunities
4. **Market Cap**: Larger tokens tend to have better arbitrage

### Risk-Adjusted Sizing

**Position Sizing Logic:**
```python
def calculate_position_size(signal, available_balance):
    # Base size from configuration
    base_size = config.trade_amount_usd
    
    # Adjust for confidence
    confidence_multiplier = signal.confidence
    
    # Adjust for liquidity
    liquidity_limit = min(signal.buy_size, signal.sell_size) * 0.1
    
    # Apply risk limits
    max_position = config.max_position_size
    
    # Calculate final size
    adjusted_size = base_size * confidence_multiplier
    position_size = min(adjusted_size, liquidity_limit, max_position)
    
    return position_size
```
